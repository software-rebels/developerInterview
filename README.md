## Introduction

Thank you for attending this interview! 
This page shows questions and our recent results.
In this interview, we would like to discuss two themes as below:

### Theme 1: Does CI activeness change over time?
```markdown
*What kinds of CI jobs are used in Nova project?*
- pep8, tox-python, docs, functional job
- Tempest_dsvm_cells
- Tempest_dsvm_full_devstack_plugin_ceph
- Tempest−dsvm−neutron−multinode−ful
- Tempest−dsvm−multinode−live−migration
- Grenade_dsvm_neutron_multinode
- Tempest−dsvm−ipa−wholedisk−bios−agent
```
```markdown
*How does CI activeness change over time?*
- Our research shows that CI activeness tends to decease once it becomes mature. For example, while pep8 job arrived at almost 100% in early period, it decreased to 85% in late period.

### Theme 2: How does CI impact code review behavior?
```markdown
*How CI activeness jobs will go over time?*
How do CI jobs impact review:
 - quality (content, quality etc.)?
 - cost (time, #revision etc.)?
 - motivation (participation etc.)?
```

```markdown
*What is the challenge of CI in the future?*
based on the previous discussion.
